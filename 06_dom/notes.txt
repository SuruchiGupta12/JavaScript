Introduction:

DOM stand for document object model
Window is an object and document is its property
console.log(document)
we make tree diagram =  window->document->html->head,body->....
console.log(document.baseURL)   gives baseURL of that webpage
console.log(document.links)     gives all the links present in that web page in form of HTMLcollection but can accessed using [0] for 1st url [1] for 2nd url etc.
document.getElementById("id_name") = gives that id tag and we can change it also by using further.innerHTML = <h1> CHai </h1> 

2nd video of DOM :

document.getElementById('id_name').id = gives id/class of that given id
document.getElementById('id_name').className = gives class name of that id
document.getElementById('id_name').getAttribute('id/class') = gives attributes value like key-value pair
document.getElementById('id_name').setAttribute('class','my_class') = changes/sets/overwrites attribute value
this long values can be stored in a var eg-
const title = document.getElementById('id_name')
now this can be used to refer and make changes
title.style.backgroundColor = 'green'
how to add content?
title.textContent =  gives content written in that id
title.innerHTML & title.innerText also gives the same value
but diff b/w textContent & innerText is innerText shows only the text visible on webpage whereas textContent shows all the actual txt present in html file
innerHTML shows all the html code written inside that content
document.querySelector('h1')    gives the first h1 tag
document.querySelectorAll('h1')    gives all h1 tag present 
document.querySelector('#title')    gives tag with id as title same for class with .class_name
for selecting any tag we can use querySelector and put it in variable and do manipulation

Nodelist and HTMLcollection are not pure array but can be treated as array or can be changed to array Nodelist contains prototype of foreach but HTMLcollection doesnt
const temp= document.querySelectorAll('li') 
now temp is a Nodelist and this can be accessed as array by using indexes and not directly
const temp= document.getElementByClassName('list-item')
this return a HTMLcollection and here for-each loop is not there so to use those property we need to convert it to array
to convert to array we use = Array.from(temp)     now we can use property of array on temp
const myarr = Array.from(temp)
myarr.forEach (function (item){
    item.style.Color = 'orange' 
})
